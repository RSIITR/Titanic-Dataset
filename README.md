The 'Titanic' folder consists of the dataset used for training and prediction, and the code and submission(prediction on test set).
Though this a beginner dataset and code, the approach has been taken differently using the concept of 'Neural Network' under 'Keras' framework.

The main moto of this project/repository was to participate in Kaggle's Beginner Competetion.

Achieved a maximum accuracy of 78.468%.
